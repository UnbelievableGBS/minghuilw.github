## About

I am **Minghui Liwang (李王明卉)**, an Associate Professor at the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, and a member of the Shanghai Research Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems.

My research focuses on **services computing**, **multi-agent systems**, **distributed machine learning**, and **edge intelligence for Internet of Vehicles (IoV)**. I develop decision and optimization methods that bridge theoretical rigor and practical deployment constraints in dynamic networked systems.

I have published 80+ SCI journal and international conference papers, with 50+ papers as first or corresponding author.

## Research Interests

- Services computing and resource trading over cloud-edge-end architectures
- Multi-agent collaboration and robust online optimization
- Hierarchical and distributed federated learning under intermittent participation
- Cross-disciplinary intelligence systems for industrial and vehicular scenarios
